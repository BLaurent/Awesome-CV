\lettersection{About Me}
Hi, my name is Benoit Laurent and I think you should hire me !

I am a husband, a father of two (Girl 2.5y and Baby WIP 3m;). This is a bit cliché, but I love food and cooking for my friends and family. I enjoy walking barefoot in the sand at sunset with my family.
I am having a lot of fun, reading original version Shakespeare's plays and visiting art exhibits. I love to share this with my kids when I can.
I live closed to a large forest which makes running extremely enjoyable, as you can sometimes encounter deer.

\lettersection{Why Google?}
I've attended several Google cloud summits in Paris, also been to mountain view. The atmosphere so unique,
the mission so clear, how can we make better products for you, our customers.
The attention to the details, the cohesive offer everything come so well together it's really a piece of art.
Also, Google offers a different point of view on people, during the last summit in Paris, inviting Mélody Donchet was a brilliant idea during the feminine soccer world cup, to promote diversity.
Google does take an important role to promoting equity which makes me wanting to join even more.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I am looking for my next challenge, a position where I can have an impact. I've always loved learning new things about science, technologies but above all about people, having talented and diverse people around me, simply just make me a better person.
I've been doing many things in my career, starting as humble software engineer fixing bugs during months, up to software architect helping customers shaping their future to the next digital era. I still code every day, this help me staying sane and sharp.
Sometimes, I like to think about myself as Jean-Cloud Van Damme doing a full split between two chairs, doing extremely low-level system performance optimizations on one side and deploying high-level architectures on the other side. I can embrace the whole picture: IOT, On Prem, Cloud.
I've talked with customers about their challenges, about cloud when to use it or not.
For this reason, I am a perfect fit for this job.
