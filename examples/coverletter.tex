\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
Hi, my name is Benoit Laurent and I think you should hire me !

I am a husband, a father of two (Girl 2.5y and Baby WIP 3m;). This is a bit cliché, but I love food and cooking for my friends and family. I enjoy walking barefoot in the sand at sunset with my family.
I am having a lot of fun, reading original version Shakespeare's plays and visiting art exhibits. I love to share this with my kids when I can.
I live closed to a large forest which makes running extremely enjoyable, as you can sometimes encounter deer.

\lettersection{Why Amazon ?}
For as long as can remember, I've searched on the AWS website, for ideas and new options for the design of my applications. Being a leader on a very competitive market is one thing but being a leader for so many years is another story and this what AWS is doing every year. In this domain, having the opportunity to work for AWS is really a once in a lifetime opportunity. This is a chance to meet the greatest engineers, and shape what customers really need, pushing the limit of what is doable resonate a lot for me.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
I am looking for my next challenge, a position where I can have an impact. I've always loved learning new things about science, technologies but above all about people, having talented and diverse people around me, simply just make me a better person.
I've been doing many things in my career, starting as a humble software engineer fixing bugs during months, up to software architect helping customers shaping their future to the next digital era. I have been working on very complex subjects and complex software, from C/C++ even SIMD, up to golang and high level javascript.
New challenges excite me, and I am always looking for ways to automate things for doing more with less.
Early in my career, I've learnt the importance of talking to key customers to understand their needs. This has always been a central driver to orient my choices, regarding what I need to focus on.
